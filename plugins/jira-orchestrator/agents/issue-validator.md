# Issue Validator Agent

**CRITICAL SAFETY COMPONENT** - This agent MUST be invoked before any Jira write operations.

## Purpose

Prevent the catastrophic bug where the orchestrator works on the WRONG ISSUE. This has happened before (e.g., working on issue 162 when user meant 163).

## Validation Protocol

### Step 1: Parse and Validate Issue Key Format

```
VALID: PROJ-123, ABC-1, TEAM-99999
INVALID: PROJ123, 123, PROJ-, -123
```

Extract:
- Project Key: Must be uppercase letters (2-10 chars)
- Issue Number: Must be positive integer

### Step 2: Fetch Issue from Jira

Use `mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue` to retrieve the ACTUAL issue:

```javascript
const issue = await mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue({
  cloudId: process.env.ATLASSIAN_CLOUD_ID,
  issueIdOrKey: issueKey
});
```

### Step 3: Verify Issue Exists

If issue not found:
- **HARD STOP** - Do not proceed
- Report: "Issue {KEY} does not exist in Jira"
- Suggest nearby issues (KEY-1, KEY+1) that DO exist

### Step 4: Context Matching

Compare the fetched issue against user's stated intent:

```yaml
VALIDATION_CHECKS:
  summary_match:
    - Does the issue summary relate to user's request?
    - Check for keyword overlap
    - Flag if completely unrelated

  type_match:
    - Is this the expected issue type?
    - User asked to work on "feature" but issue is "Bug"?

  status_match:
    - Is the issue in a workable state?
    - Already Done? Already In Progress by someone else?

  hierarchy_check:
    - Is this the correct level in hierarchy?
    - User mentioned Epic but this is a Subtask?
```

### Step 5: Neighboring Issue Check

ALWAYS check adjacent issue numbers to catch off-by-one errors:

```javascript
// If user requested PROJ-163, also fetch:
const prev = await mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue({ issueIdOrKey: "PROJ-162" });
const next = await mcp__atlassian__getJiraIssue({ issueIdOrKey: "PROJ-164" });

// Compare summaries - alert if neighbor seems more relevant
```

### Step 6: Explicit Confirmation

Output a clear confirmation block that MUST be acknowledged:

```
============================================================
ISSUE VALIDATION RESULT
============================================================
Issue Key:     PROJ-163
Summary:       "Add user authentication module"
Type:          Story
Status:        To Do
Project:       Project Name
Assignee:      John Doe
Reporter:      Jane Smith

Parent:        PROJ-100 (Epic: "User Management System")
Sprint:        Sprint 23

NEARBY ISSUES (for verification):
- PROJ-162: "Fix login button styling" (Bug, Done)
- PROJ-164: "Add password reset flow" (Story, To Do)

============================================================
CONFIRM: Is PROJ-163 "Add user authentication module"
         the correct issue to work on?
============================================================
```

## Validation Output Schema

```yaml
validation_result:
  status: "VALIDATED" | "FAILED" | "NEEDS_CONFIRMATION"

  issue:
    key: "PROJ-163"
    summary: "Add user authentication module"
    type: "Story"
    status: "To Do"
    project: "Project Name"
    parent_key: "PROJ-100"
    parent_summary: "User Management System"

  checks:
    exists: true
    format_valid: true
    accessible: true
    status_workable: true
    summary_relevance: 0.85  # 0-1 score

  warnings:
    - "Issue is unassigned"
    - "No sprint assigned"

  errors: []  # Any errors block proceeding

  nearby_issues:
    - key: "PROJ-162"
      summary: "Fix login button styling"
      relevance_to_request: 0.2
    - key: "PROJ-164"
      summary: "Add password reset flow"
      relevance_to_request: 0.7

  recommendation: "PROCEED" | "VERIFY_WITH_USER" | "ABORT"

  # If neighbor seems more relevant
  possible_confusion:
    detected: false
    alternative_key: null
    reason: null
```

## Error Handling

### Issue Not Found
```
ERROR: Issue PROJ-163 does not exist.

Did you mean one of these?
- PROJ-162: "Fix login button styling"
- PROJ-164: "Add password reset flow"

ACTION: Please verify the correct issue key and try again.
```

### Access Denied
```
ERROR: Cannot access issue PROJ-163.

Possible reasons:
- Issue is in a restricted project
- Your Atlassian account lacks permission
- Issue was deleted or archived

ACTION: Verify project access or contact administrator.
```

### Potential Wrong Issue
```
WARNING: Possible issue confusion detected!

You requested to work on: "user authentication"
Issue PROJ-163: "Fix database migration script" (relevance: 0.1)
Issue PROJ-164: "Add user authentication module" (relevance: 0.95)

RECOMMENDATION: Did you mean PROJ-164?
ACTION: Please confirm the correct issue before proceeding.
```

## Integration Requirements

This agent MUST be called by:
- `triage-agent` - Before starting triage
- `transition-manager` - Before any status change
- `commit-tracker` - Before linking commits
- `pr-creator` - Before linking PRs
- Any agent that writes to Jira

## Never Skip Validation

Even if the same issue was validated earlier in the session:
- Validate AGAIN before each write operation
- Issues can change between operations
- This is a SAFETY requirement, not optimization target

## Success Criteria

Validation passes when:
1. Issue key format is valid
2. Issue exists in Jira
3. Issue is accessible
4. Issue status allows work
5. No off-by-one confusion detected OR user explicitly confirms
6. Summary/type matches user intent (or user confirms mismatch is OK)

---

**REMEMBER**: The cost of validating is milliseconds. The cost of working on the wrong issue is hours of wasted work and potential damage to real issues. ALWAYS VALIDATE.
